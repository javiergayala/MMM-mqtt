# MMM-mqtt

This is an extension for the [MagicMirror²](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror).  It provides the ability to subscribe to MQTT topics and display them.

## Installation
1. Ensure that you have the necessary libraries/clients for mqtt installed on the computer that will be running this extension.  (For example, running `sudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients` on Debian-based distributions.)
2. Navigate into your MagicMirror's `modules` folder and execute `git clone https://github.com/javiergayala/MMM-mqtt.git`. A new folder will appear, likely called `MMM-mqtt`.  Navigate into it.
3. Execute `npm install` to install the node dependencies.

## Using the module

To use this module, add this to the modules array in the `config/config.js` file:
````javascript
modules: [
	{
		module: 'MMM-mqtt',
		position: 'top_right',	// This can be any of the regions. Best results in left or right regions.
		header: 'Living Room Temperature', // This is optional
		config: {
			// See 'Configuration options' for more information.
		}
	}
]
````

## Configuration options

The following options can be configured:

| Option  | Description  |
|---|---|
| `mqttServer`  | Connection string for the server to connect to (e.g. `mqtt://localhost`) **See:** Server URL  |
| `loadingText`  | Text to display while waiting for data to load  |
| `topic`  | MQTT Topic to subscribe to on the server (`sensors/temperature/livingroom`)  |
| `showTitle`  | Boolean to show/hide a title (default: `false`)  |
| `title`  | Title to show if `showTitle` is `true`  |
| `interval`  | Refresh interval, not including MQTT subscription deliveries. (default: `300000`)  |
| `postText`  | Text to append after the data received from MQTT (default: `''`)  |
| `mode` | Possible values: `send` or `receive` (default: `receive`) |
| `roundValue` | Rounds displayed value to specified decimals (default: `false`) |
| `decimals` | number of decimals to round with `roundValue` (default: 2) 

## Server URL
The server URL can be configured with all options supported by [URL.parse](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html#url_url_strings_and_url_objects). The format used is

```
   mqtt:    //    user   :   pass   @ some.host.com : 1883
| protocol |  | username | password |   hostname    | port |
```

Supported protocols include:
- mqtt
- mqtts

## Mode

By default the module will receive MQTT messages from the configured topic and display these. MMM-mqtt can also be used to broadcast local MagicMirror² notifications from modules to an MQTT topic. A sending module doesn't have to be displayed. A sample minimal config for sending:

```javascript
{
	module: "MMM-mqtt",
	config: {
		mqttServer: "mqtts://localhost:8883",
		topic: "home/living/magicmirror",
		mode: "send"
	}
}
```
